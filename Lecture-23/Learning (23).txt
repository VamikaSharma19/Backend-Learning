üìå What we have done in this folder?
In this folder, we have built a blog management system with user authentication.

‚ô¶Ô∏è User Management: 
Users can be created and stored in the database with essential details such as email, username, and password.
Each user also maintains a personal collection of blogs they have authored.

‚ô¶Ô∏è Authentication & Security:
The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access.
When a user logs in with valid credentials, a token is generated and provided to them.
This token must be included in subsequent requests, and the middleware verifies its validity before allowing access.
Only authenticated users can perform protected operations, ensuring that data is secure and user-specific.

‚ô¶Ô∏è Blog Management:
Authenticated users can create new blogs. Each blog is automatically linked to the user who created it.
Users can only update or delete their own blogs. 
The system strictly checks ownership before making any modifications, thereby preventing unauthorized access.
When a blog is deleted, its reference is also removed from the corresponding user‚Äôs record, keeping data relationships consistent.

‚ô¶Ô∏è Database Relationships:
A one-to-many relationship is maintained between users and blogs.
Each blog document stores a reference to its author (user), while each user keeps a list of all blogs they own.
