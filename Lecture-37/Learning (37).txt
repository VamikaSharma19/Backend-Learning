📌 What is Indexing?
Indexing is a database technique used to speed up data retrieval from a table or collection.
An index works like a book index, where we can directly find the required page instead of reading the entire book.

📌 Why Indexing is Needed?
Without indexing, the database performs a full table scan.
Full table scan means checking each row one by one & this becomes slow when data is large.
Indexing allows faster search, filtering, and sorting.

📌 How Indexing Works?
An index stores an indexed column value which pointes to the actual row/document.
When a query uses an indexed column, it uses the index first and then directly jumps to the required data.

📌 Indexing in PostgreSQL -
Creating an Index:
CREATE INDEX idx_phone ON address(phone);

Speeds up queries like:
SELECT * FROM address WHERE phone = '28303384290';

📌 Indexing in MongoDB -
Creating an Index:
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 });

📌 Types of Indexes - 
1. Single Column Index - (Index on one column)
2. Composite Index – (Index on multiple columns)
3. Unique Index – (Prevents duplicate values)
4. Primary Index – (Automatically created on primary key)

📌 What is the Singleton Pattern?
This pattern ensures that class has only one instance throughout the application & provides global access point to that instance.
In other words, the object is created only once and same object is reused everywhere.

📌 Real-World Analogy of Singleton Pattern -
School System Example:
A school can have many teachers and students, but it should have only one Principal.
So no matter how many times the Principal is requested, the same Principal object must be returned.

📌 Key Rules of Singleton Pattern -
To implement a Singleton, we must follow these rules:
1. The class should have only one instance
2. The instance should be stored inside the class
3. Object creation should be restricted
4. Access should be provided via a static method
