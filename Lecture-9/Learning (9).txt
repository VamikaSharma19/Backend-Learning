📦 Important Concepts:
1. app.use(express.json()) - 
This is middleware that allows the Express app to automatically parse incoming JSON data in the request body & attach it to req.body.

2. JSON Format - (key : value)
In JSON, keys must be in string format, but values can be of multiple types. 
Example :
"age" : 19

3. req.body -
This is an object that holds the parsed JSON data from the request body.

🔍 How the Request Works: 
We are using Thunder Client (a REST API testing extension in VS Code) to send a POST request to:
http://localhost:3012/hello
In Thunder Client, we go to the Body tab and select JSON format.
We then enter our data like this:
{
  "name": "Vamika",
  "age": 19,
  "email": "vamika@gmail.com"
}
This data is sent in the body of the POST request.

📝 File Handling Logic: 
We first read the content of hello.txt using fs.readFile.
Once we get the data, we concatenate the new input with the existing content and then write it back using fs.writeFile.

❌ Why not use fs.appendFile()?
We avoided fs.appendFile() because:
It simply appends data without giving us control over the entire file content.
Here, we wanted to read and then append formatted data, making the write more structured.
