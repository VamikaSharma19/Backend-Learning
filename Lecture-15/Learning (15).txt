üìå What is Axios?
Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client that works in both Node.js and the browser.
It allows us to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to APIs and receive responses.
It automatically transforms JSON data and supports features like request/response and error handling.

üìå Some key points:
1. The fetch() function is provided by browsers natively, 
But Axios is a third-party library, so we have to explicitly include it in our folder.
2. While inspecting the Network tab in the browser‚Äôs developer tools, we checked the type of data Axios was sending. 
In the Content-Type header, it showed application/json, which means that by default Axios sends data in JSON format.
3. Because of this, we added the express.json() middleware in our Express server to parse JSON request bodies. 
Along with that, we also added another middleware to handle other possible content types, 
since sometimes the type of incoming data is not known in advance.
4. In Axios, the actual response data is accessed using response.data.

‚û°Ô∏è We can use websites like JSONPlaceholder to get fake APIs for testing purposes.
