📌 What is Redis?
Redis is an in-memory data store — extremely fast because it stores data in RAM.
Common uses : Caching, session store, and storing small structured objects (hashes).
Data types : Strings, hashes (field → value mapping), lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, streams, etc.
Pros : Low latency, simple API, many data structures.
Cons : Data is in memory (so size limited by RAM) — configure persistence if we want data to survive we have to restart.

📌 What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages an application and its dependencies into a portable container image.
Containers isolate apps from the host environment while sharing kernel resources — 
They are lightweight compared to virtual machines.
Use Docker to run services (like Redis) reproducibly on any machine without manual installation.

📌 Command-by-command Explanation -

1. docker run redis -
Runs the redis image and starts a container.

➡️ Default behavior without flags : 
The container runs attached to our terminal (stdout/stderr show in the terminal). 
If we close the terminal (or press Ctrl+C), the container will stop.
If the image is not present locally, Docker will pull redis:latest.

2. docker run -p 6379:6379 redis -
Starts a container and maps the container’s port 6379 (Redis default) to the host’s port 6379.
This makes Redis reachable from the host at localhost:6379.
-p = This is how we usually run Redis for local development, but if we close the terminal, container will stop running. 

3. docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis -
-d (detached mode) : 
Container runs in the background and our terminal is free.

4. docker ps -
Lists running containers. 
Useful columns : CONTAINER ID, IMAGE, STATUS, PORTS, NAMES.

5. docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:latest -
redis:latest = Explicitly uses the latest tag of the Redis image (same as just redis by default).

6. docker exec -it containerId redis-cli - 
This opens a Redis CLI prompt inside the running container so we can run Redis commands interactively.

7. set "user" '{"name":"Vamika", "age":"19"}' -
This is a Redis command (used inside redis-cli) that stores a single string value under the key user.
It stores the JSON as a plain string value.
