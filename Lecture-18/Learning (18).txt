ðŸ“Œ What we have done in this folder?
In this folder, we have implemented blog deletion and updation for users. 
Just like on Instagram, a user can only delete or update their own posts, here too only the owner of a blog can delete or update it.
Thatâ€™s why, for updating or deleting a blog, we need both the userId and the blogId.

ðŸ“Œ Note:
In HTTP, GET requests are used only to retrieve data from the server, which is why they donâ€™t carry a request body. 
Any information that needs to be passed in a GET request (like an ID or filter) is always sent through URL parameters or query strings.

On the other hand, requests like POST, PUT, and DELETE are meant to send data to the server (to create, update, or remove something).
Thatâ€™s why these requests usually include a request body where the required data is provided.
