📌 What we have done in these files?
Both files i.e. users.js & index.js together implement User Authentication.
The index file handles signup and login logic using Express and MongoDB.
The model file defines the User schema for storing user details.

🔑 Authentication vs Authorization:

♦️ Authentication (Is the User Valid?) - 
It means verifying the identity of a user.
It checks "Who are you?"
It is usually done through Email/Username + Password, OTP, Fingerprint, or Token.
If authentication fails → user cannot even enter the system.
If authentication succeeds → user is considered valid and can move forward.

♦️ Authorization (Is the Request Valid?) - 
It means verifying what actions the authenticated user is allowed to perform.
It checks "What can you do?"
Example: Different users may have different roles (admin, editor, normal user).
Even if a user is authenticated, they may not have the right to access certain resources.
