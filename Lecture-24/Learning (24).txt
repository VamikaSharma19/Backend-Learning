ðŸ“Œ What we have done in this folder - 
User signs up with email, username, and password.
On successful signup, a success message appears and the form resets.
User logs in with credentials.
On successful login, token and user ID are stored, a success message appears, and the form resets.
After login, the user can:
Add new blogs
View all blogs 
View their own blogs
Update or delete their blogs 

After logging in, if we want to check whether the token is stored, we click on Inspect, then go to the Application tab. 
Under the Local Storage dropdown, select our localhost path, and there we can see the stored token.
