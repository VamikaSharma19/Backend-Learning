ðŸ“Œ What we done in this folder?
This is a Blogging Backend where users can register, create blogs, view blogs, and only the owner can update or delete their blogs. 
All these operations are implemented using routes and managed through controllers for handling the logic.

ðŸ“Œ Routes:
Routes define the paths (URLs) that the client can request from the server.
Each route is linked to a specific function (controller) that decides what response to send when that route is called.
Routes are the "entry points" of our application that connect users to functionalities.

ðŸ“Œ API (Application Programming Interface):
It is a set of rules and endpoints that allow communication between client and server.
In web development, APIs are usually built using HTTP methods:
GET â†’ Retrieve data
POST â†’ Create data
PUT/PATCH â†’ Update data
DELETE â†’ Remove data
APIs provide a structured way for applications (frontend, mobile app, or external service) to interact with the backend.
Example: A Blogging API have endpoints like:
/api/users â†’ manage users
/api/blogs â†’ manage blogs

ðŸ“Œ Controllers:
A controller is a part of backend architecture that contains the logic for handling incoming requests.
When a request comes to a route, the route forwards it to the controller, and the controller decides how to process it.
Controllers act as a bridge between the routes (API endpoints) and the database/services.
