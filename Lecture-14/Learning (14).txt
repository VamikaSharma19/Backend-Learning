ðŸ“Œ What we have done here - 
In this folder, we have created a User Data page that displays all registered users.
When a new user is registered, an alert popup appears, and the form fields are automatically cleared.
Later, when we visit the User Data page again, the previously registered users are displayed there.
Additionally, all user information is also stored in a users.json file.

ðŸ“Œ fetch() with POST Method: 
When we want to send data (e.g. form data) to the server, we use the POST method.

âœ… Syntax - 
fetch(URL, {
    method: "POST",    (HTTP method)
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"  (Type of data being sent)
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)      (Convert JS object to JSON string)
})
.then(response => response.json())    (Parse response into JS object)
.then(data => {
    console.log("Success:", data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
});

ðŸ“Œ What is preventDefault()?
It is a built-in JavaScript method that stops the browserâ€™s default behavior for a particular event.
When we submit a form, the default behavior is to reload/refresh the page and send form data to the server.
Using preventDefault() stops that automatic reload so we can handle the data manually using fetch().
