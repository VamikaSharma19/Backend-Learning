📌 What is MongoDB?
1. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents (similar to JSON objects).
2. These documents are stored in collections (similar to tables in relational databases).
3. Internally, MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.

📌 What is Mongoose?
1. Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
2. It helps map JavaScript objects to MongoDB documents.

📌 Schema in Mongoose: 
1. A Schema defines the structure of a document in a collection.
2. It specifies the fields, their types, and any validations.

📌 Model in Mongoose:
1. A Model is a JavaScript class created from a Schema.
2. It represents a MongoDB collection and provides methods to interact with the database.

♦️ findById() →
Retrieves a single document by its _id.

(C) Update Data - 
♦️ findByIdAndUpdate() →

♦️ updateOne() →

♦️ updateMany() → 
Updates all documents that match the filter.

(D) Delete Data -
♦️ findByIdAndDelete() → 
Finds a document by _id and deletes it in a single step.

♦️ deleteOne() → 
Deletes only the first document that matches the filter.

♦️ deleteMany() → 
Deletes all documents that match the filter.
