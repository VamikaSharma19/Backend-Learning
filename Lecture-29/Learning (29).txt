ðŸ“Œ In this folder, we have created both Tweet and User modules â€” 
Including their respective controllers & other supporting functions. 
We have used Prisma ORM for database management and interactions.
Each user can have their own tweets, means there is a one-to-many relationship between User and Tweet.

ðŸ“Œ To view the database via the command line, follow these steps:
psql -U postgres
\c lecture-29
Select * FROM "User";
Select * FROM "Tweet";
