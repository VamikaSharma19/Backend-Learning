📌 What are include and select in Prisma?
When working with Prisma ORM, we often fetch data from the database using methods like findMany() or findUnique().
To control which fields or related data should be retrieved, Prisma provides two key options:
1. select
2. include

🟢 select — Used to fetch specific fields only
This keyword allows us to retrieve only particular columns from a table and ignore the rest.

🟣 include — Used to fetch related data (relations)
This keyword allows us to retrieve related data from another table that is connected via a relationship (like one-to-many).

⚠️ Important Rule -
We cannot use include and select together at the same level in a Prisma query.
However, we can nest them — meaning we can use one inside the other.
