📌 DOM: appendChild() vs append():
To insert an element into the DOM, we must have its parent container.

1️⃣ appendChild():
Adds a single node (element or text node) to the end of a specified parent element’s child list.
Rules:
Accepts only one node at a time.
Cannot directly insert text strings (must be a text node).
Returns the appended node.

2️⃣ append():
Adds one or more nodes or text strings to the end of a specified parent element’s child list.
Rules:
Can append multiple nodes or strings in one call.
Returns undefined (does not return the appended node).

📌 In files (index.html & index.js):
We created a small square box in HTML that changes its background color automatically when the Generate button is clicked.
It stops changing when the Stop button is clicked & remain fixed at the last color that was displayed before the button was clicked.

📌 In files (index (1).html & index (1).js):
We created a basic Todo Application that displays a list of tasks using JavaScript & DOM manipulation.
